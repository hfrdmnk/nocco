A personal website is your corner of the internet. Unlike social media profiles that come and go, your own domain is permanent real estate that you control completely.

## Why Build Your Own Site?

The modern web has made this easier than ever. Static site generators like Hugo let you build fast, secure sites without databases or complex infrastructure. You write in Markdown, push to Git, and your site deploys automatically.

**Why bother?** Because owning your content matters. When platforms change their algorithms or shut down entirely, your personal site remains. It's where you can experiment, express yourself, and build something that's *truly yours*.

### The Benefits

Here's what you get with your own website:

- **Full control** over your content and design
- No algorithm deciding who sees your posts
- A permanent home for your work
- Freedom to experiment with new ideas

### Getting Started

If you're ready to build, here's a simple process:

1. Pick a static site generator (Hugo, Astro, 11ty)
2. Choose a domain name that represents you
3. Write your first post
4. Deploy to a host like Netlify or Vercel

> The best time to start a personal website was ten years ago. The second best time is now.

#### Technical Considerations

You'll want to think about performance. A simple site should load in under a second. Use tools like `lighthouse` to audit your pages, and keep your CSS minimal.

Here's a basic Hugo config:

```toml
baseURL = "https://example.com"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My Site"
theme = "nocco"
```

That's it. Start simple, iterate often, and make it yours. Check out the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for more details.
