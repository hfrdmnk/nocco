A personal website is your corner of the internet. Unlike social media profiles that come and go, your own domain is permanent real estate that you control completely.

The modern web has made this easier than ever. Static site generators like Hugo let you build fast, secure sites without databases or complex infrastructure. You write in Markdown, push to Git, and your site deploys automatically.

**Why bother?** Because owning your content matters. When platforms change their algorithms or shut down entirely, your personal site remains. It's where you can experiment, express yourself, and build something that's truly yours.
